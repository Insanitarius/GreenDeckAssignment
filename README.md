## Steps to run it
1. Download the code
2. Do "npm install" in the main
3. Do "cd client" and again do "npm install"
4. Do "cd .." and "npm run dev" to start both frontend and backend at once.
5. I have concurrently set up so you don't have to run client and server separately but if you wish to do so then
    > use "npm run client" from one terminal and "npm run server" from another terminal

### Note: .env file is not provided since it contain confidential keys please set connection to mongoDB to run it
